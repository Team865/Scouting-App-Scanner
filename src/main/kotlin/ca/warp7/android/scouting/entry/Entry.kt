/**
 * Data model for the scouting app. Strictly, it follows
 * a per-match-per-board model, but it can be mostly
 * taken as per-match-per-team. Each instance contains
 * a stack of data recorded for that particular entry,
 * which can be classified into two groups: 1) data points
 * of a singular magnitude, such as the robot's starting
 * position and its subjective driving speed; in such cases,
 * it is usually desirable to know what the last-most value
 * set to them; and 2) the time series in which each data
 * point records the occurrence of a particular action at
 * a specific time, and there may be multiple values of
 * this type that are of equal interest to the data collector,
 * such as recording whenever a game piece is picked up
 * by the robot; in these cases, it may be helpful to know
 * the the count, the parity(Start/End), duration between each
 * occurrence, or a combination of the above. In stack of data
 * are recorded according to their time of input as referenced
 * by the time tracked by the scouting interface; this means
 * that even if a data point does not track time, the stack
 * should preserve the order of input nonetheless.
 *
 * Changed in V6: the tracked time is now precise to the
 * 1/100th of a second. Match does not include the full
 * key anymore, it now excludes year and match type.
 * Scout now has an underscore in it. Undo count is
 * removed. Due to the new binary search algorithms in the
 * implementation, a new invariant requires that the
 * data point list must be sorted by time
